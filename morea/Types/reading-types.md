String basics:
A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed within single (' ') or double (" ") quotes. Strings are used to represent text data and can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace. They are a fundamental data type and support various operations for manipulation and analysis.

```python
# Creating strings
string1 = "Hello, world!"    # Using double quotes
string2 = 'Python is fun!'   # Using single quotes

# Concatenating strings
full_string = string1 + ' ' + string2
print(full_string)

# String indexing and slicing
message = 'Hello world!'
first_char = message[0]  # Accessing the first character

# String length
length = len(message)

# String formatting
name = 'Alice'
age = 30
info = 'Name: {}, Age: {}'.format(name, age)  # Using the format() method
f_info = f'Name: {name}, Age: {age}'          # Using f-strings
```

In this example, various string operations are demonstrated, including string creation, concatenation, indexing, length calculation, and formatting. Strings are versatile and play a crucial role in text processing and manipulation tasks in Python.

List basics:
A list in Python is a mutable, ordered collection of items, enclosed within square brackets []. Lists can contain elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists. Lists are versatile data structures used for storing, organizing, and manipulating collections of data.

```python
# Creating lists
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
mixed_list = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]

# Accessing list elements
first_item = numbers[0]    # Accessing the first element
second_item = fruits[1]    # Accessing the second element

# Modifying list elements
fruits[0] = 'grape'        # Changing an element's value

# List length
num_items = len(numbers)

# List methods
numbers.append(6)          # Adding an element to the end
fruits.insert(1, 'cherry') # Inserting an element at a specific index
removed_item = numbers.pop()   # Removing and returning the last element
```

In this example, various list operations are showcased, including list creation, element access, modification, length calculation, and method usage. Lists are fundamental data structures in Python, widely used for managing and manipulating collections of items.

Tuple basics:
A tuple in Python is an immutable, ordered collection of elements enclosed within parentheses (). Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, their elements cannot be modified after creation. Tuples are often used to group related data together and represent fixed sets of values.

```python
# Creating tuples
point = (3, 4)                # Creating a 2-element tuple
person = ('Alice', 30, True)  # Creating a tuple with mixed data types

# Accessing tuple elements
x = point[0]                   # Accessing the first element
name = person[0]               # Accessing the first element

# Tuple length
num_elements = len(point)
```

In this example, various tuple operations are demonstrated, including tuple creation, element access, and length calculation. Tuples are suitable for scenarios where data should not be modified after creation, such as representing coordinates, records, or fixed sets of related values.

Set basics:
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements enclosed within curly braces {}. Sets are used to store distinct values and support various mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, and difference. Sets are mutable, allowing elements to be added or removed after creation.

```python
# Creating sets
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}

# Adding elements to a set
numbers.add(6)                # Adding a single element
fruits.update(['cherry', 'apple'])  # Adding multiple elements

# Removing elements from a set
numbers.remove(3)             # Removing a specific element (raises an error if not present)
fruits.discard('banana')      # Removing a specific element (no error if not present)
removed_item = numbers.pop()  # Removing and returning an arbitrary element

# Set operations
unique_fruits = fruits.union({'grape', 'kiwi'})  # Union of two sets
common_fruits = fruits.intersection({'banana', 'apple'})  # Intersection of two sets
different_fruits = fruits.difference({'banana', 'apple'})  # Difference between two sets

# Set membership and length
is_in_set = 'apple' in fruits  # Checking if an element is in the set
num_elements = len(numbers)
```

In this example, various set operations are demonstrated, including set creation, adding and removing elements, set operations (union, intersection, difference), membership checking, and length calculation. Sets are useful for scenarios where you need to store unique values and perform mathematical set operations efficiently.

Dictionary basics:
A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces {}. Each key is associated with a value, forming a mapping that allows you to retrieve values using their corresponding keys. Dictionaries are versatile data structures used for storing and organizing data in a structured and efficient manner.

```python
# Creating dictionaries
student = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 20,
    'is_student': True
}

# Accessing dictionary values
name = student['name']
age = student['age']

# Modifying dictionary values
student['age'] = 21

# Adding new key-value pairs
student['grade'] = 'A'

# Removing key-value pairs
del student['is_student']

# Dictionary methods
keys = student.keys()       # Get a list of keys
values = student.values()   # Get a list of values
items = student.items()     # Get a list of key-value pairs

# Dictionary membership and length
has_key = 'grade' in student   # Checking if a key is in the dictionary
num_entries = len(student)
```

In this example, various dictionary operations are demonstrated, including dictionary creation, value access and modification, adding and removing key-value pairs, dictionary methods (keys, values, items), membership checking, and length calculation. Dictionaries are highly useful for tasks that involve mapping keys to values and organizing data based on meaningful associations.

Type conversions:
Type conversions, also known as type casting or type coercion, refer to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. Python provides built-in functions and techniques to perform various type conversions, enabling you to manipulate and process data of different types as needed.

```python
# Integer to Float
int_value = 5
float_value = float(int_value)

# Float to Integer
float_number = 3.14
int_number = int(float_number)

# Integer to String
number = 10
number_str = str(number)

# String to Integer
string_number = '20'
int_string = int(string_number)

# String to Float
float_string = '3.14159'
float_number = float(float_string)
```

In this example, various type conversions are demonstrated, such as converting between integers, floats, and strings. These conversions are essential for manipulating data, performing calculations, and adapting data types to suit specific programming needs.
