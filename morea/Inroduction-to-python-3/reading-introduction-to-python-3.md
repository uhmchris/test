Print:
The print statement in Python is a built-in function used to display textual or variable content in the console or terminal. It allows developers to output information for debugging, user interaction, or general program communication. The print() function accepts one or more arguments, which can be strings, variables, or expressions, and displays their values as text.

```python
# Display a simple message
print('Hello world!')

# Print the result of an expression
y = 20
z = x + y
print('The sum of x and y is:', z)
```

In this example, the print() statements output various messages and the result of an expression to the console. The output helps developers understand program behavior and aids in the debugging and development process.

Comment:
Comments in Python are textual annotations that provide explanations, context, or notes within the source code. They are preceded by the hash symbol # and are ignored by the Python interpreter during program execution. Comments enhance code readability, aid in documentation, and facilitate collaboration among developers.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print('Hello world!')  # This is a comment explaining the print statement
```

In this example, the comments provide additional information about the code's purpose and functionality, making it easier for developers to understand the logic and intent behind the code.
